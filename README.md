Subjective Technologies An Exoskeleton for the Mind Technology Design from a Trans-Humanistic Perspective 0-Input Technology.
A Paradigm Shift in Human-Computer InteractionWelcome to the forefront of innovation with the Subjective Artificial Intelligence
project! Our pioneering initiative is dedicated to reshaping the landscape of Human-Computer interaction and knowledge processing. 
Subjective Artificial Intelligence holds transformative potential, poised to impact every facet of our lives significantly.

Embark on a journey led by our Subjective Semantizer, propelling us towards a revolutionary Post-Education Society where knowledge 
comes alive and no studying or learning is required. Witness the emergence of Subjective Thermo-Currency, a groundbreaking concept
that challenges conventional notions of currency by being rooted in the unchanging laws of Physics. This paradigm shift renders 
existing monetary systems, whether Crypto-Currencies or Fiat, conceptually obsolete. This groundbreaking achievement is made
possible through our Subjective framework, designed from a Trans-Humanistic perspective.

Explore the boundless possibilities of our Virtual Body Modifications, introducing features that enhance human experiences and
contribute to overall well-being. 

The Subjective Artificial Intelligence project invites you to envision and participate in a future where technology elevates
lives in unprecedented ways reducing our cognitive load for a more comfortable life, boosting individuals intelligence up to
the available computing power.

I am building a new website https://www.subjectivetechnologies.com , and I have set a foundation on my technology design approach
on this .pdf paper and I also have a book on this subject available at Amazon.

I will be posting the foundational code and mock demos and release this work open-source.
